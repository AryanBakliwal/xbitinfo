Retrieve information content and compress accordingly.

This will be a wrapper around [BitInformation.jl](https://github.com/milankl/BitInformation.jl) to retrieve and apply bitrounding from within python.
The package intends to present an easy pipeline to compress (climate) datasets based on the real information content.
